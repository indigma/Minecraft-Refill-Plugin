# Minecraft-Refill-Plugin
An easy to use refill plugin for minecraft (1.8 tested, might work for other versions)

Refills your inventory's empty slots with the given potion
It also has a cooldown which you can edit easily in config.yml, if you had a full inventory and didn't get any soups from the command, you wont get the cooldown.

Use command /refill, you can add aliases in config.yml
You can set potion ID in config.yml if you want to give other potions, or you can edit the code really simply and set it to soups
